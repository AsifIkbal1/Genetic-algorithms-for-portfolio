Genetic algorithms for portfolio
The target's of work
Read the data.
Calculate the historical returns for 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 24 months and 36 months for each of the stocks.
Define Gene : A fraction of the total capital assigned to a stock.
Define Chromosome : Set of genes i.e. fractions of total capital assigned to each stock. Sum of each chromosome should be equal to 1.
Generate Initial Population : A set of randomly generated chromosomes.
Fitness function (Function). Sharpe ratio.
Select Elite Population (Function): It filters the elite chromosomes which have highest returns, which was calculated in fitness function.

Mutation: A function that will perform mutation in a chromosome. Randomly we shall choose 2 numbers between 0, 5 and those elements we shall swap.

Crossover: Heuristic crossover or Blend Crossover uses the Ô¨Åtness values of two parent chromosomes to ascertain the direction of the search. It moves from worst parent to best parent.

Next Generation (Function): A function which does mutation,mating or crossover and builds a new generation of chromosomes.

Iterate the process: Iterate the whole process till their is no change in maximum returns or for fixed number of iterations.
